Use a Model-Practice-Reflect instructional cycle to teach writing strategies.\n\nA Model-Practice-Reflect approach allows students to observe the thinking and actions of a strong writer, attempt to emulate the features of effective writing, and then evaluate their writing according to those features (as illustrated in Figure 1.2). By learning from teachers, peer models, and their own written work, students can internalize the features of effective writing and develop effective writing strategies, skills, and knowledge. Writing practice without reflection does not provide students with opportunities to internalize important features of writing or think about how to apply learned skills and strategies effectively in new situations.\n\nTeachers should employ a Model-Practice-Reflect approach during writing instruction and classroom activities, gradually transitioning responsibility until students are using writing strategies independently."

These goals can be set by the writer or teacher, or through collaboration between the writer, teacher, and/or peers.\n\n• Is appropriate for the intended audience and context. For example, a persuasive text written for a school newspaper may look different than one written for an online forum.\n\n• Presents ideas in a way that clearly communicates the writer's intended meaning and content. The writer's ideas are well-organized and clear to the reader, and expressed effectively.\n\n• Elicits the intended response from the reader. For example, a persuasive text compels the reader to take action, whereas a mystery novel elicits feelings of suspense or surprise from the reader."

        "text": "Each SAFE Lesson Plan has four components: stimulus, activity, follow-up, and evaluation (Tiedt & Johnson, 1988b, p. 3). The key words of this plan form the acronym \"SAFE.\" Let's examine each component of the SAFE Lesson Plan.\n\nStimulus\n\nStimulus is any prewriting activity of the lesson that is intended to stimulate writing. Stimulus activities include listening to a story read aloud, watching a film, and attending a field trip. It is a good idea for the writing teacher to engage the students in a group discussion in preparation for the main activity.\n\nActivity\n\nThe main activity of the lesson is the performance by the students. This performance typically will be some form of writing. Students may write sentences, paragraphs, stories, reports, letters, poems, essays, and so forth. On occasion, the activity may be oral, designed to parallel the writing process. In this case, they may perform skits or role-play situations they imagine.\n\nFollow-up\n\nThe follow-up activity of the lesson occurs after the main activity. The follow-up typically will be a postwriting activity. Postwriting activities include editing, rewriting, or completing a written piece that was started. Postwriting activities are important to the success of a lesson, because such activities are motivating and encourage further writing.\n\nEvaluation\n\nTeachers should use a variety of techniques to evaluate students' writing. It is a good idea to have students evaluate each others' work. Student evaluations provide students the opportunity to develop critical judgment and a greater appreciation for the writing process. This can be accomplished by exchanging papers or by having students work in small groups. The teacher may read students' papers aloud or have students read their papers. Or teachers may collect papers, write comments on the papers, and assign grades. Whatever system is used, teachers need to emphasize the worth of each writing attempt. This will stimulate students to continue writing. Figure 1 provides a format for the SAFE Lesson Plan."

This might include goals for maintaining control of the topic, organization, voice, use of mature vocabulary, and use of varied and complex sentences to meet the writing purpose. Students should choose one or more goals to work on as they write.\n\nIndividualize goals, Any genre\n• Provide students with a list of individualized writing goals and have them select one or more goals to focus on while writing. For a persuasive essay, for example, one student's goal may be to write an essay that includes three reasons to support his or her point of view. Alternatively, the goal might be to reject three reasons that are not consistent with his or her point of view. The goals should be individualized so that they are more ambitious than the student's performance on a previous essay, but not so high as to be outside the student's capabilities.\n\nSCHEME, Any genre\n• Skills check. Complete an inventory that focuses on what you are currently doing well when writing and what you need to improve on.\n• Choose goals. Based on the skills check, develop goals for your next writing assignment (e.g., find a quiet place to write, reread my paper before turning it in, and get all the information I need before I write).\n• Hatch a plan for how to meet your specified goals.\n• Execute the plan for achieving your goals.\n• Monitor progress toward achieving your goals."

She evaluates her proof using the Compare-Diagnose-Operate (CDO) strategy. She then asks the students to solve a second problem and to explain in writing how they solved the problem. The teacher then models how she solved the second problem. As a whole class, students discuss what they did well in their written explanations and where they needed to re-think their solution or written explanation using the CDO strategy. Teachers can also share student exemplars.\n\nSocial studies, 3-2-1 summary strategy\nA social studies teacher models summarizing a recent political debate that the class watched together online. He identifies three main points or ideas presented during the debate, two disagreements between the candidates, and one question that he has for the candidates. Students then write a summary of the debate using this 3-2-1 strategy and work in small groups to discuss their summaries.\n\nSocial studies, Peer revising strategy\nA social studies teacher selects a student to model peer revising with her at the front of the class. The teacher and the student review each other's summaries of current events to identify two strengths and two areas for improvement. The teacher and student discuss the strengths and weaknesses, including strategies for improving the weaknesses. Then, students work in pairs to discuss and review each other's summaries of current events.\n\nEnglish language arts, Outlining strategy\nAn English language arts teacher models using an outline to plan for a descriptive analysis on a novel the class recently read. To structure his outline, he creates major headings to discuss the primary characters, setting, plot, themes, and symbolism. He discusses a few of the minor points he will use to populate the section on characters. He then asks the class to work in groups to populate key points for the section on theme, including specific page references. Students then select a book to read independently and are asked to produce an outline for an accompanying descriptive analysis."

She considers what concepts her audience may be familiar with (mixing or combining ingredients) and what concepts may be unfamiliar (beating an egg). Students then write their own recipes and later trade recipes with a partner.
