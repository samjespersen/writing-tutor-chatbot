Use a Model-Practice-Reflect instructional cycle to teach writing strategies.\n\nA Model-Practice-Reflect approach allows students to observe the thinking and actions of a strong writer, attempt to emulate the features of effective writing, and then evaluate their writing according to those features (as illustrated in Figure 1.2). By learning from teachers, peer models, and their own written work, students can internalize the features of effective writing and develop effective writing strategies, skills, and knowledge. Writing practice without reflection does not provide students with opportunities to internalize important features of writing or think about how to apply learned skills and strategies effectively in new situations.\n\nTeachers should employ a Model-Practice-Reflect approach during writing instruction and classroom activities, gradually transitioning responsibility until students are using writing strategies independently."

        "text": "Each SAFE Lesson Plan has four components: stimulus, activity, follow-up, and evaluation (Tiedt & Johnson, 1988b, p. 3). The key words of this plan form the acronym \"SAFE.\" Let's examine each component of the SAFE Lesson Plan.\n\nStimulus\n\nStimulus is any prewriting activity of the lesson that is intended to stimulate writing. Stimulus activities include listening to a story read aloud, watching a film, and attending a field trip. It is a good idea for the writing teacher to engage the students in a group discussion in preparation for the main activity.\n\nActivity\n\nThe main activity of the lesson is the performance by the students. This performance typically will be some form of writing. Students may write sentences, paragraphs, stories, reports, letters, poems, essays, and so forth. On occasion, the activity may be oral, designed to parallel the writing process. In this case, they may perform skits or role-play situations they imagine.\n\nFollow-up\n\nThe follow-up activity of the lesson occurs after the main activity. The follow-up typically will be a postwriting activity. Postwriting activities include editing, rewriting, or completing a written piece that was started. Postwriting activities are important to the success of a lesson, because such activities are motivating and encourage further writing.\n\nEvaluation\n\nTeachers should use a variety of techniques to evaluate students' writing. It is a good idea to have students evaluate each others' work. Student evaluations provide students the opportunity to develop critical judgment and a greater appreciation for the writing process. This can be accomplished by exchanging papers or by having students work in small groups. The teacher may read students' papers aloud or have students read their papers. Or teachers may collect papers, write comments on the papers, and assign grades. Whatever system is used, teachers need to emphasize the worth of each writing attempt. This will stimulate students to continue writing. Figure 1 provides a format for the SAFE Lesson Plan."

The teacher and student discuss the strengths and weaknesses, including strategies for improving the weaknesses. Then, students work in pairs to discuss and review each other's summaries of current events.\n\nEnglish language arts, Outlining strategy\nAn English language arts teacher models using an outline to plan for a descriptive analysis on a novel the class recently read. To structure his outline, he creates major headings to discuss the primary characters, setting, plot, themes, and symbolism. He discusses a few of the minor points he will use to populate the section on characters.

Write arguments to support claims in an analysis of substantive topics or texts, using valid reasoning and relevant and sufficient evidence.\na. Introduce precise claim(s), distinguish the claim(s) from alternate or opposing claims, and create an organization that establishes clear relationships among claim(s), counterclaims, reasons, and evidence.\nb. Develop claim(s) and counterclaims fairly, supplying evidence for each while pointing out the strengths and limitations of both in a manner that anticipates the audience's knowledge level and concerns.\nc. Use words, phrases, and clauses to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships between claim(s) and reasons, between reasons and evidence, and between claim(s) and counterclaims.\nd. Establish and maintain a formal style and objective tone while attending to the norms and conventions of the discipline in which they are writing.\ne. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from and supports the argument presented.\n\n2. Write informative/explanatory texts to examine and convey complex ideas, concepts, and information clearly and accurately through the effective selection, organization, and analysis of content.\na. Introduce a topic; organize complex ideas, concepts, and information to make important connections and distinctions; include formatting (e.g., headings), graphics (e.g., figures, tables), and multimedia when useful to aiding comprehension.\nb. Develop the topic with well-chosen, relevant, and sufficient facts, extended definitions, concrete details, quotations, or other information and examples appropriate to the audience's knowledge of the topic.\nc. Use appropriate and varied transitions to link the major sections of the text, create cohesion, and clarify the relationships among complex ideas and concepts.\nd. Use precise language and domain-specific vocabulary to manage the complexity of the topic.\ne. Establish and maintain a formal style and objective tone while attending to the norms and conventions of the discipline in which they are writing.\nf. Provide a concluding statement or section that follows from and supports the information or explanation presented (e.g., articulating implications or the significance of the topic).\n\n3. Write narratives to develop real or imagined experiences or events using effective technique, well-chosen details, and well-structured event sequences.\na. Engage and orient the reader by setting out a problem, situation, or observation, establishing one or multiple point(s) of view, and introducing a narrator and/or characters; create a smooth progression of experiences or events.\nb. Use narrative techniques, such as dialogue, pacing, description, reflection, and multiple plot lines, to develop experiences, events, and/or characters.\nc. Use a variety of techniques to sequence events so that they build on one another to create a coherent whole.\nd. Use precise words and phrases, telling details, and sensory language to convey a vivid picture of the experiences, events, setting, and/or characters.\ne. Provide a conclusion that follows from and reflects on what is experienced, observed, or resolved over the course of the narrative.\n\nProduction and Distribution of Writing\n\n4. Produce clear and coherent writing in which the development, organization, and style are appropriate to task, purpose, and audience. (Grade-specific expectations for writing types are defined in standards 1-3 above.)\n\n5. Develop and strengthen writing as needed by planning, revising, editing, rewriting, or trying a new approach, focusing on addressing what is most significant for a specific purpose and audience. (Editing for conventions should demonstrate command of Language standards 1-3 up to and including grades 9-10 on page 55.)\n\n6. Use technology, including the Internet, to produce, publish, and update individual or shared writing products, taking advantage of technology's capacity to link to other information and to display information flexibly and dynamically.\n\nResearch to Build and Present Knowledge\n\n7. Conduct short as well as more sustained research projects to answer a question (including a self-generated question) or solve a problem; narrow or broaden the inquiry when appropriate; synthesize multiple sources on the subject, demonstrating understanding of the subject under investigation.\n\n8. Gather relevant information from multiple authoritative print and digital sources, using advanced searches effectively; assess the usefulness of each source in answering the research question; integrate information into the text selectively to maintain the flow of ideas, avoiding plagiarism and following a standard format for citation.\n\n9. Draw evidence from literary or informational texts to support analysis, reflection, and research.\na. Apply grades 9-10 Reading standards to literature (e.g., \"Analyze how an author draws on and transforms source material in a specific work [e.g., how Shakespeare treats a theme or topic from Ovid or the Bible or how a later author draws on a play by Shakespeare]\").\nb.
